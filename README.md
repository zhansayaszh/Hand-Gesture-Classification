# Hand-Gesture-Classification
## Setup
- Please install Pytorch https://pytorch.org/
- Download datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innominate817/hagrid-classification-512p, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innominate817/hagrid-classification-512p-no-gesture, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhansayasovetbek/hagrid384pbalanced
## Dataset
HaGRID (HAnd Gesture Recognition Image Dataset) for hand gesture recognition (HGR) systems. 
HaGRID size is 716GB and dataset contains 552,992 FullHD (1920 Ã— 1080) RGB images divided into 18 classes of gestures. Also, some images have no_gesture class if there is a second free hand in the frame. This extra class contains 123,589 samples. The data were split into training 92%, and testing 8% sets by subject user_id, with 509,323 images for train and 43,669 images for test.
